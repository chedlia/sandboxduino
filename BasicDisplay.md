Setup:
**Arduino UNO**SainSmart 1602 LCD Keypad Shield
**USB power supply.**

### Notes: ###
  * make sure to install keypad library in(MacOS only):
> /Applications/Arduino.app/Contents/Resources/Java/libraries/

  * I had to change few things is those libraries to get them to work. Added missing includes, and replaced old includes with constants(wiring file). keypad library can be found in ./libraries/keypad directory
