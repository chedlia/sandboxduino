This project contains code samples and libraries tested on Arduino UNO [R3](https://code.google.com/p/sandboxduino/source/detail?r=3).
You will find code samples for:
  * SainSmart LCD keypad shield
  * Dual Stepper Motor driver shield
  * other basic experiments
  * SainSmart Stepper Motor Shield (Adafruit shield clone)
  * Other tips and tricks that I've learned.

I needed to update and trace some problems with those libraries, so hope you will find this useful.

You can find all the libraries and source code here: [source code](https://code.google.com/p/sandboxduino/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk)

Libraries can be found here: [libraries](https://code.google.com/p/sandboxduino/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Flibraries)

You can find some project descriptions on this page: [Experiments page](Experiments.md).
