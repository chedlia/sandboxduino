#summary Building self driving small robot

= Setup =
 * Arduino Uno R3
 * SainSmart L293D Motor Drive Shield
 * TowerPro Micro Servo
 * HC-SR04 ultrasonic module
 * Tamiya 70108 Tracked Vehicle Chassis
 * Tamiya Double Gearbox L/R Independ 4-speed TAM70168
 * 2x 9V battery
 * jumper wires(male/female + female/female)
 * on/off switch(any type with six legs)

 * plastic scraps (cd boxes, printer plastic parts etc)
 * small prototype board


= Goal =

The goal is to create self driving robot that will be able to avoid obstacles.
 
== Stage 1: == 
 * arduino with motor shield
 * attached two DC motors
 * mounted on/pff switch on prototype board
