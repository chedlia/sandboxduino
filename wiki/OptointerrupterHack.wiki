# Optointerrupter made into optocoupler.

= Introduction =

I found several optointerrupters in old printers and I needed optocoupler. I decided to hack a optointerrupter and make it into optocoupler.

== IF YOU DON"T HAVE INTERRUPTERS - DON'T BUY ONE JUST TO HACK IT, IT"S NOT WORTH IT(it's around 10$ on ebay), BUY OPTOCOUPLER. ==


==Setup:==

 * Optointerrupter from old printer
 * 220OHM resistors
 * jumper connectors
 * two VCC sources
 * LED
 * dremmel

Those two parts are basically made out of two components:
- LED
- photoresistor

Optocoupler completely separates two circuits, helps you to protect expensive parts from the rest of the circuit. I needed one to separate my camera from Arduino.

There's one small difference between optointerrupters and optocoupler: optointerrupter uses the same VCC for both LED and photoresistor and this is what needs to be hacked:

==Notes==
Make sure to use 220 OHM resistors for infrared LED - otherwise it will be damaged.
