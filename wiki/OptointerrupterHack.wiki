# Optointerrupter made into optocoupler.

= Introduction =

I found several optointerrupters in old printers and I needed optocoupler. I decided to hack a optointerrupter and make it into optocoupler.

Setup:
- Optointerrupter from old printer
- 220OHM resistors
- jumper connectors
- two VCC sources
- LED

Optointerrupter:

Those two parts are basically made out of two components:
- LED
- photoresistor

Optocoupler completely separates two circuits, helps you to protect expensive parts from the rest of the circuit. I needed one to separate my camera from Arduino.

There's one small difference between optointerrupters and optocoupler: optointerrupter uses the same VCC for both LED and photoresistor and this is what needs to be hacked:

==Notes==
Make sure to use 220 OHM resistors for infrared LED - otherwise it will be damaged.
