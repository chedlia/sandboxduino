 * HC-SR04 ultrasonic module
 * jumper wires(male/female + female/female)

I got this toy from my friend. He found it on a garage sale, so it was like 2$. Original toy comes with IR remote, but this one was missing it. Since it didn't do anything without a pilot I decided to rebuild it and give it some personality.

I think this toy is worth buying new just to make to a robot. It's 13$ on amazon, so fairly cheap and this is what you get in package:
 * two motors with gears(you would normally probably paid 10$ for it)
 * even more motors, one that turns the head, one that turns eyes, one that opens/closes eyes.
 * H bridges - yup, at least 4 full blown H bridges - equivalent of 20$ arduino motor shield.
 * plenty of LEDS, 
 * few switches
 * IR pilot, receiver, processor and this can be reused for other projects.

I need to mention that this toy is creepy. My 2 year old son is terrified of it. You don't want to buy it for your kids...

This is what you will see when you open the robot:

I have taken all the plastic off, disconnected LEDs and IR receiver.
It turned out that black cable going from body to head, contains 5V, 9V, ground cables, and more cables that are connected to switches. Switches are used as sensors detecting tower rotation. FE when the tower(head) turns right it reaches switch that disconnects the motor etc.

Red cable is used to supply power to motors.

All you need from black cable is those three cables:
BLACK: GND
ORANGE: 5V
RED : 9V
