# self driving robot built based on toy saved from garage sale.

= Setup =
 * Arduino Uno R3
 * Parents Go Bot
 * 9V battery to power arduino
 * HC-SR04 ultrasonic module
 * jumper wires(male/female + female/female)

I got this toy from my friend. He found it on a garage sale, so it was like 2$. Original toy comes with IR remote, but this one was missing it. Since it didn't do anything without a pilot I decided to rebuild it and give it some personality.

Original toy:

I think this toy is worth buying new just to make to a robot. It's 13$ on amazon, so fairly cheap and this is what you get in package:
 * two motors with gears(you would normally probably paid 10$ for it)
 * even more motors, one that turns the head, one that turns eyes, one that opens/closes eyes.
 * H bridges - yup, at least 4 full blown H bridges - equivalent of 20$ arduino motor shield.
 * plenty of LEDS, 
 * few switches
 * IR pilot, receiver, processor and this can be reused for other projects.

I need to mention that this toy is creepy. My 2 year old son is terrified of it. You don't want to buy it for your kids...

This is what you will see when you open the robot:

I have taken all the plastic off, disconnected LEDs and IR receiver.
It turned out that black cable going from body to head, contains 5V, 9V, ground cables, and more cables that are connected to switches. Switches are used as sensors detecting tower rotation. FE when the tower(head) turns right it reaches switch that disconnects the motor etc.

Red cable is used to supply power to motors.

All you need from black cable is those three cables:
BLACK: GND
ORANGE: 5V
RED : 9V

I cut away the rest of the cables from the black cable. You could potentially try to use switches to determine tower position, but I decided not to to it, just to simplify things a bit.

Then, I removed processor and sound processor from the board:

This is how I connected arduino to H bridges

Cables have been soldered to a board and will be connected to arduino output pins. High signal enables forward or backward for each motor. 
I've checked that you can actually use 5V arduino output to turn on motors by connecting 5V to each of those points. Just by checking every point I figured out what is what. 

Motor 1 and motor 2 are responsible for moving the toy. Motor 3 is responsible for head turns.

I have decided to remove two motors. I removed the one that was responsible for head turning, and the one that was responsible for moving eyes left and right. I didn't want to turn the head to make things simpler. And I think the eyes motor h bridge was broken. I was unable to figure out wheat was wrong there, so I just skipped it.

The next thing was to attach ultra sound sensor:
