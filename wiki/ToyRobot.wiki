I got this toy from my friend. He found it on a garage sale, so it was like 2$. Original toy comes with IR remote, but this one was missing it. Since it didn't do anything without a pilot I decided to rebuild it and give it some personality.

I think this toy is worth buying new just to make to a robot. It's 13$ on amazon, so fairly cheap and this is what you get in package:
 * two motors with gears(you would normally probably paid 10$ for it)
 * even more motors, one that turns the head, one that turns eyes, one that opens/closes eyes.
 * H bridges - yup, at least 4 full blown H bridges - equivalent of 20$ arduino motor shield.
 * plenty of LEDS, 
 * few switches
 * IR pilot, receiver, processor and this can be reused for other projects.

I need to mention that this toy is creepy. My 2 year old son is terrified of it. You don't want to buy it for your kids...

This is what you will see when you open the robot:
