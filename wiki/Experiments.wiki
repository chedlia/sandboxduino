= Introduction =

This page describes briefly experiments and code samples.


= Details =

==BasicDisplay==
Setup:
*Arduino UNO
*SainSmart 1602 LCD Keypad Shield
*USB power supply.

===Notes:===
  * make sure to install keypad library in(MacOS only): 
  /Applications/Arduino.app/Contents/Resources/Java/libraries/

  * I had to change few things is those libraries to get them to work. Added missing includes, and replaced old includes with constants(wiring file). keypad library can be found in ./libraries/keypad directory


==BlinkLed==
Name says it all.  Delay based blink code.
 Setup:
  *Arduino UNO
  *1 led + 220OHM resistor(pin 9)

==FadeLed==
Led fading using delays and PWM output. Code is simple, one loop that changes output power on PWM.
 Setup:
  *Arduino UNO
  *1 led + 220OHM resistor(pin 9)

==StepperMotor==
Stepper motor example.
 Setup:
  *Arduino UNO
  * Cana Kit stepper motor(MERCURY MOTOR SM-42BTG011-25) -available on amazon.
  * Dual stepper motor shield(SHD037)
  *12V DC power supply(12V drill battery)

===Notes:===
  * connect 12V power supply to motor shield
  * connect motor to X motor shield slot(X01A - RED, X01B GREEN, X02A YELLOW, X02B BLUE)
  * MAKE SURE THAT MOTOR CONNECTION IS TIGHT, DO NOT DISCONNECT MOTOR WHILE SHIELD IS POWERED, it will damage the shield.
